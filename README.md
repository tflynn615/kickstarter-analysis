# kickstarter-analysis
After evaluating a number of Kickstarter campaigns, I have the below recommendations for your interest in raising money for a play in the US. For further details, I have provided the data in [data-1-1-3-StarterBook](path/to/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlxs).

First, after evaluating all Theater kickstarters in the available data, it is apparent that most successful campaigns began in the month of May. 

Of the five plays that you were intersted in, their goals fell largely in the $1,000 to $2,000 range. This aligns well with the statistical analysis which found that half of the average successful theater campaigns were goaled for less than $3,000. The average goal for successful campaigns was approximately $5,000 compared to the $10,000 average seen with failed campaigns, which seems skewed by some large goals in this area. Here, I recommend goaling your campaign for less than $5,000 to increase chances of success. 

To evaluate your interest in British musicals, we did a box plot analysis which found the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so here I would recommend that your goal be less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
